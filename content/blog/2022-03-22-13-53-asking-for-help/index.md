The following is a good guideline in asking and escalating your issue. Please consider all the steps before directly going to the last point.

> When you find the answer, make sure to update the relevant threads and places you've asked. This promotes knowledge sharing and - no matter how silly it seems - will help somebody in the future. If it’s a recurring problem, others _have_ faced the same struggle. Consider writing either a company or personal blog post and sharing it.

If you feel you aren’t getting the support you need from your team (or line manager), escalate accordingly.

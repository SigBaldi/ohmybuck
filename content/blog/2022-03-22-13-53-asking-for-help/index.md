The following is a good guideline in asking and escalating your issue. Please consider all the steps before directly going to the last point.

**Most importantly - if you find the answer, make sure to update the relevant threads and places. This promotes knowledge sharing and - no matter how silly it seems - helps people in the future. If it’s a recurring problem or others have faced the same struggle, consider writing either a company or personal blog post and sharing it.**

If you feel you aren’t getting the support you need from your team or line manager, make sure to bring this up and escalate accordingly.

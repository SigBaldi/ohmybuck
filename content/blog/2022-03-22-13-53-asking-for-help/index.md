The following is a good guideline in asking and escalating your issue. Please consider all the steps before directly going to the last point.

When you find the answer, make sure to update the relevant threads and places you've asked. This promotes knowledge sharing and - no matter how silly it seems - will help somebody in the future. If it’s a recurring problem, others _have_ faced the same struggle. Consider writing either a company or personal blog post and sharing it.

If you feel you aren’t getting the support you need from your team (or line manager), escalate accordingly.

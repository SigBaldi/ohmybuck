## Interview sessions

There should be multiple sessions, each in attempt to bring to light the candidates skill in the technical domain.

An interview session should last about 45 minutes:

- 5 minutes on introductions, getting the candidate comfortable, explaining the format
- 35 minutes on one main question
- 5 minute wrap up at the end where the candidate has an opportunity to ask questions

Interviews should uncover the candidates experience and knowledge in the following Technical Domains:

- Technical Experience

- Coding Ability

  Evaluating the following key areas:

  - Execution: Can they deliver on their listed training and experience?
  - Competency: What is their ability to write and reason about code?
  - Communication: Can they explain what they're doing and why?

- System Design ability

  Evaluating the following key areas:

  - Systems thinking: Are they able to both think holistically about the problem and dig into details?
  - Decision-making: What factors are they employing when making decisions? Can they explain why they would chose X or Y?
  - Communication: We want to hear their thought-process and assumptions as they make them.

- can they turn your business goals into technical strategy?

## A good interview question

Should:

- be easy enough that it can be solved in 35 minutes
- be non-trivial in the sense that candidates will need to spend at least a few minutes thinking about possible solutions before diving in
- lend itself to different possible solutions that have different performance characteristics (often there is a “brute force” solution and then a more efficient solution)
- be “extensible” so that if a candidate gets the basic solution quickly you can make it harder by asking variations of it
- be “hintable” so that if a candidate gets stuck early on you can nudge in the right direction without fully giving it away

Should not:

- require any specialized knowledge beyond basic coding and algorithms (unless you are interviewing for a specialized role)
- be an “aha” type puzzle – no questions where you need a flash of insight to get it right (how does an insect get out of a blender, or why are manhole covers circular type questions)

The point of the interview, and I always stress this prior to starting with a candidate, is not just to see if the candidate can get to the correct answer. It’s much more about seeing how the candidate approaches a problem. I want to see whether the candidate:

1. Takes the time to understand the question
1. Asks clarifying questions before starting to solve the problem
1. Writes down example inputs and their corresponding outputs to think through various cases
1. Breaks the problem down into simpler subparts
1. Starts with the simplest solution even if it’s slower (I always ask them to do this)
1. Takes instruction well when they are heading down the wrong path
1. Asks questions when they get stuck
1. Outlines the algorithm before writing the code
1. Writes code that is at least basically syntactically correct in the language of their choice
1. Describes in words what they are doing and how they are thinking
1. Proves to themselves and the interviewer that their proposed solution works
1. Can engage in a discussion about different possible solution strategies
1. Can describe the performance of their solution and think through possible optimizations
1. Can describe test cases they would write to validate their solution

## Interview etiquette

- Whiteboard interviews can be very intense for candidates and it’s important that the interviewer be mindful and understanding. There is nothing gained by increasing the pressure – it’s already a very contrived setup so you should try your hardest to be sympathetic and put the candidate at ease.
- Always emphasize that getting the solution is not everything and that you care just as much about how they think through the problem, the questions they ask, whether they would fit the culture and so on.
